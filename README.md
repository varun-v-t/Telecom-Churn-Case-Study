# Telecom Churn Case Study

## Business Problem Overview
In the telecom industry, customers are able to choose from multiple service providers and actively switch from one operator to another. In this highly competitive market, the telecommunications industry experiences an average of 15-25% annual churn rate. Given the fact that it costs 5-10 times more to acquire a new customer than to retain an existing one, customer retention has now become even more important than customer acquisition.

For many incumbent operators, retaining high profitable customers is the number one business goal.

To reduce customer churn, telecom companies need to predict which customers are at high risk of churn.

## Understanding and Defining Churn
There are two main models of payment in the telecom industry - postpaid (customers pay a monthly/annual bill after using the services) and prepaid (customers pay/recharge with a certain amount in advance and then use the services).

In the postpaid model, when customers want to switch to another operator, they usually inform the existing operator to terminate the services, and you directly know that this is an instance of churn.

However, in the prepaid model, customers who want to switch to another network can simply stop using the services without any notice, and it is hard to know whether someone has actually churned or is simply not using the services temporarily (e.g. someone may be on a trip abroad for a month or two and then intend to resume using the services again).

Thus, churn prediction is usually more critical (and non-trivial) for prepaid customers, and the term ‘churn’ should be defined carefully.  Also, prepaid is the most common model in India and southeast Asia, while postpaid is more common in Europe in North America.

This project is based on the Indian and Southeast Asian market.

## Business Objective
The business objective is to predict the churn in the last (i.e. the ninth) month using the data (features) from the first three months. To do this task well, understanding the typical customer behaviour during churn will be helpful.

## Models
- Random Forest
- XGBoost
- Logistic Regression to identify important variables
